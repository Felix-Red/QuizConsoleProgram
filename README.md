# Simple C# Quiz Console Application
This is a simple C# Quiz Console Application that I created to explore classes and console interactions in C#. The program presents quiz questions to the user, accepts their input, and provides feedback on their answers.

## Future Improvements
- Add more question types (e.g., timed questions).
- Implement scoring and leaderboards.
- Save quiz results to a file or database.
